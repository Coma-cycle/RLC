hi!
this is a simpole project i did back when we first learnt about circuits with AC inputs, 
and this is specificly desined for a simple RLC parrallel circuit with an ac current input , 
and the scrpipt has been writen in python , 

the libraries used are : numpy, matplotlib

i was trying to show the phasor current signal of each edge of the ciruit , and the angle 
differace between current of inductor  , capacitor and the resistor. the red vector is Ir,
the green vector is IC, the blue vector is IL.

i know it can be imporoved and for some inputs it has some bugs , i appreatiate commits :)
